              <p> <b> Cause of extinction: </b> hunting, lack of prey, loss of forest habitat </p>
              <p> They used to inhabit their native land Java, Indoneisa. The native people regarded
                them as pests in the mid 1800s - mid 1900s however, and chased them to
                remote mountainous areas. The remaining tigers were moved to the Meru Betiri National
                Park Reserve by 1972, but the number of tigers still diminished. The last few were seen
                1976 before officially declared extinct in 2003. </p>

              <p> A subspecies of black rhinos. They were hunted for their horns that were sold on the
